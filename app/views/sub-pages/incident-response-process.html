        <p class="govuk-body">
            This document should be treated as a standard process to follow in the event of a cyber incident. It aims to
            be as specific as possible, but it is important to use it as a template to create your own Cyber Response
            Plan (CRP).
            <br><br>
            Adapting this process to fit your setting will allow you to make specific references to
            actions appropriate for your IT infrastructure and IT support arrangements. This will help to eliminate
            confusion and ensure clarity during a live incident, where clear communication and tactful decision making
            is essential.
            <br><br>
            The process can be applied to all potential cyber security incidents, but certain types
            of incidents require a more tailored response. We have developed <a href="/playbooks-landing-page.html"
                class="govuk-link">incident-specific playbooks</a> that can help
            you to focus and respond effectively in these situations.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        In an educational setting, Detection can include monitoring systems, staff, learners, legal
                        guardians or third parties such as IT providers or your local authority. 
                        <br><br>
                        Education settings should encourage all parties to actively monitor and respond to these various
                        sources. Where necessary, this should trigger the subsequent stages of the incident response
                        process as laid out in the Cyber Response Plan.

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 1 – Detection</h3>
                    <p>A report or alert is received by the designated individual or team, usually IT support, service
                        provider or the SLT Digital Lead. Some settings may have IT support with a Security Operations
                        Centre (SOC).</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 2 – Logging</h3>
                    <p>The report is recorded in an Incident Log with key details including date, source, description
                        and initial risk judgement.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 3 – Initial assessment</h3>
                    <p>The SLT Digital Lead, in consultation with IT support or other stakeholders with relevant skills,
                        makes a quick preliminary assessment to see if:  
                    </p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>the activity is harmless</li>
                        <li>it could be a cyber security incident</li>
                        <li>further evidence or context is required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Where uncertainty exists, it is safer to be cautious and escalate for further assessment in the
                        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Triage and Analysis stage</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 4 – Decision to escalate</h3>
                    <p>The incident should be escalated immediately to the full incident response if any of the
                        following conditions are met:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                        <li>there is evidence of malware, data breach, or system compromise</li>
                        <li>personally identifiable or sensitive data may be at risk</li>
                        <li>key systems are disrupted or inaccessible</li>
                        <li>external parties such as the NCSC or <a href="#" class="govuk-link">cyber insurance
                                providers</a> have issued warnings or
                            alerts that apply to your environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Escalating to the full incident response will trigger the Triage and Analysis stage.  
                        <br><br>
                        You should tailor your educational setting’s escalation thresholds when creating your own
                        Incident Response Plan. This must be agreed upon by your SLT with your setting’s risk tolerance
                        in mind.
                        <br><br>
                        This should include escalation of events to senior leadership and/or external
                        bodies as appropriate. For example, in the case that personally identifiable information or
                        sensitive information may be at risk, it will be necessary for the DPO to be informed to
                        potentially notify ICO.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 5 – SLT Digital Lead – Notification to escalate cyber incident</h3>
                    <p>Once a confirmed or likely incident is identified the SLT Digital Lead is informed to initiate
                        incident management processes, including convening any relevant internal stakeholders.

                        <br><br>
                        Depending on the technical complexity and roles defined in the plan, these actions are likely to

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 1: Identify the affected systems and scope</h3>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                        <li>use logs, alerts, user reports, or information from external parties </li>
                        <li>engage with service providers if cloud-based systems are involved </li>
                        <li>record impacted systems  </li>
                        <li>tag impacted systems clearly in incident tracking tools if available</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 2: Isolate affected systems or accounts </h3>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                        <li>remove devices from the network, disconnecting Wi-Fi and unplugging ethernet </li>
                        <li>disable compromised user accounts in Active Directory / cloud platforms </li>
                        <li>revoke API keys or access tokens suspected of compromise</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 3: Prevent further spread </h3>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                        <li>apply firewall rules to block suspect IPs or ports</li>

                        <li>suspend automatic syncs or backups if they might spread infection, such as ransomware</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 4: Preserve evidence for investigation </h3>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
                        <li>capture volatile data such as logs and memory snapshots before restarting systems</li>
                        <li>save relevant emails, alerts, or error messages</li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">For most incidents, Eradication should not be delayed once containment is
                        stable.
                        <br><br>
                        Though delays can increase risk of reinfection or exploitation, there may be circumstances such
                        as collecting or preserving evidence that require appropriate actions before completing
                        Eradication.
                        <br><br>
                        Ensure IT Support and SLT Digital Leads communicate regularly during this phase, especially
                        where partial system reinstatement is being considered.  
                        <br><br>
                        Educational settings using third-party IT support must ensure they receive written confirmation
                        that affected systems have been fully cleaned and secured against future attacks. The process of
                        reducing vulnerability, known as “hardening”, helps minimise the attack surface – the number of
                        ways a system can be exploited by malicious or accidental attack.   
                        <br><br>
                        The overall aim is to make it harder for anyone to exploit weaknesses and gain access to
