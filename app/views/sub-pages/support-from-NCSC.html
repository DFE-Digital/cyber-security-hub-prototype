                        An initiative designed to protect public sector organisations by blocking access to
                        known malicious domains and preventing data exfiltration via DNS (domain name
                        system) requests.

                        <li>threat intelligence-based blocking which uses up-to-date threat intelligence to

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        Devices in a protected organisation send DNS queries to the PDNS service instead
                        of using standard DNS resolvers.
                    </p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        PDNS checks the requested domain against its threat intelligence database. If the
                        domain is safe, the request proceeds as usual. If the domain is flagged as malicious
                        the request is blocked, preventing access.
                    </p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        <strong>Benefits of PDNS include:</strong>

                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>a reduction in cyber risks by stopping access to malicious domains</li>
                        <li>minimisation of cyber attack impact, such as ransomware and phishing</li>
                        <li>real-time intelligence to improve cyber security posture</li>

                        Schools can apply for PDNS through their local authority, multi-academy trust
                        (MAT), or directly via the NCSC.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        Once implemented, all DNS requests from school devices are filtered through the
