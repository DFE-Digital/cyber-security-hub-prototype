        <p class="govuk-body">The Cyber Security Standards are part of the DFE’s Digital and Technology
            Standards and set clear expectations for cyber security in education settings.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why the standards are important</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Cyber security is the safeguarding of systems, networks, and data from cyber
            attacks. The methods of
            safeguarding range from advanced technologies such as firewalls and antivirus software, to basic yet
            essential practices such as backing up data and using strong passwords.<br><br>

            Meeting these standards shows your commitment to delivering resilient education services by reducing
            the risk of cyber attacks.<br><br>

            Cyber attacks can lead to:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>pupil and staff data loss</li>
            <li>costly budgets from the unexpected costs of responding to a cyber attack</li>
            <li>financial loss</li>
            <li>identity theft</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        {% call blueContentBox() %}
        <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Simple actions to help you meet the standards</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>These 4 actions don’t require a large budget or IT staff, yet can help prevent data loss,
            unexpected costs of responding to a cyber attack, financial loss and identity theft:</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Implementing multi-factor authentication</li>
            <li>Awareness of threats such as ransomware and phishing</li>
            <li>Ensuring password security</li>
            <li>Backing up data</li>
        </ol>
        <p class='govuk-body'>While these actions can't guarantee complete prevention of an attack, they will reduce the
            likelihood, lessen the impact, and make incidents easier to manage if they do occur. </p>
