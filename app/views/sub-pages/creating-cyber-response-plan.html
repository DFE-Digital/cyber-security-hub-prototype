    <p class="govuk-body">
      A cyber response plan lets you plan now for a future situation. Your plan should meet your needs and reflect your educational setting, cyber experience and security resources.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should also review and test your plan. The DfE cyber response guidance has suggestions for how to do this.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should include these elements in your response plan.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Purpose
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Briefly explain the purpose of your plan. Your plan should help you manage and respond to cyber incidents to:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>minimise harm</li>
      <li>restore services</li>
      <li>comply with legal and regulatory duties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Other plans, policies and procedures
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Make sure you know of other plans, policies or procedures that might be relevant to your plan. These might include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>disaster recovery plan for technical recovery</li>
      <li>business continuity plan for maintaining education delivery</li>
      <li>safeguarding policy for incidents involving students</li>
      <li>data protection and privacy policy for incidents involving potential loss of personal information</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If these plans exist for your educational setting, make sure you refer to them and include them in your plan. You may want to think about how they work together and if there are other people who need to be involved.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Objectives
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      List the objectives of the plan. They should include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>detect and respond to cyber security incidents quickly and effectively</li>
      <li>contain and eradicate threats</li>
      <li>recover affected systems and data</li>
      <li>meet legal obligations, for example data breach notification to the ICO</li>
      <li>capture lessons learned</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may want to add other objectives related to your educational setting or set by your leadership team.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Scope
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Set out what is and is not in the scope of your plan.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Preparing to handle incidents
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your plan should set out who will be involved in a cyber response. A roles and responsibilities section can make clear:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>who should be involved and when</li>
      <li>roles and responsibilities for people involved</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-digital-and-technology-standards-in-schools-and-colleges/cyber-security-standards-for-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">DfE cyber response guidance </a> lists roles that need to be carried out in an incident.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Make sure the people named in your plan can make decisions and take action. They will need to do things like:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>decide when to escalate incidents to senior stakeholders</li>
      <li>take action and run an incident response</li>
      <li>identify when IT can contain an incident without having to contact other stakeholders</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      List who will be involved in your response and their responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Communication
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should have a communication plan and pre prepared communications you can use in an incident. DfE cyber response guidelines have guidance and templates for communications.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Prepare these now, have them approved by stakeholders and include them in your cyber response plan. Make sure they are saved somewhere you can access them if your IT fails.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Record keeping
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      DfE cyber response guidance has guidance on how to keep records during an incident.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Include templates in your plan and make sure they fit your organisation&rsquo;s needs and capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Incident response process
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      DfE cyber response guidance has guidance on the process for responding to an incident. It also has a checklist.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your plan should explain what happens in each step. You can customise the steps so they suit your educational setting.
    </p>
